📘 OpenOps Core

The OpenOps Core module provides the foundational logic, utility functions, and supporting infrastructure for the OpenOps development ecosystem.
It serves as the underlying engine for higher-level tools like the OpenOps CLI and automation templates.

🚀 Purpose

OpenOps Core defines reusable components and helpers that simplify:

File and I/O utilities

Logging and process handling

Configuration management

Reusable logic modules for OpenOps-based workflows

This library is meant to be lightweight, modular, and easily imported into other OpenOps tools.
